Drag/Drop
Each plugin has a method named CreateDragDropHandler.  This returns an IHandleDropDrop, which has the following methods:
		void WhenDroppedOntoEditor(IEditor editor, DraggingContext context);
		void WhenBeingDraggedOverEditor(IEditor editor, DraggingContext draggingContext);
		void WhenEnteringEditor( IEditor editor, DraggingContext context) ;
		void WhenLeavingEditor( IEditor editor, DraggingContext draggingContext ) ;

		DragDropEffects DragDropEffects
		{
			get ;
		}

		object this[string name] { get; set; }

An example is when dragging textures:  The TextureEditorPlugin returns a TextureDragDropHandler.  The WhenEnteringEditor method is:
			var entityCreationProperties = (EntityCreationProperties) _properties[@"CreationProperties"];
			_entityCreation = IoC.Editor.StartCreatingEntityNow(entityCreationProperties);

... and the WhenBeingDraggedOverEditor looks like:
			if (_entityCreation != null)
			{
				_entityCreation.CurrentEditor.SetPosition(MouseStatus.WorldPosition);
			}
			
			draggingContext.DragEventArgs.Effect = DRAG_DROP_EFFECTS;



Nice to have:
Each plugin specifies their own properties editor (instead of using the properties grid)



Changed:

MEF

Fixed align scale/align rotation

Upgraded to .NET 4/XNA 4

Added Lib folder with Ooki.Dialogs

Added ReadMe

Image lists now don't lock the files in the content folders enabling the user to delete files while the app is running.

Used the replacement Ookii folder browser dialog.

Changed file/save filename filters to use *.gleed and *.xml

Added FileSystemWatcher to content folder

Added ability to specify command line args to automatically open level file (now means that shell 'open with' now works)

Level.cs is now linked to project

NuGet

Fixed bug when pressing Alt+F4 to exit (was recognising as just F4 to center view)

Embedding the KryptonEffect.fx file in Gleed2D.plugins.Krypton
--
Create a content project - add the Fx file in it.  Reference it from the plugin itself.  Embed the xnb in a resource
and use the ResourceContentManager
